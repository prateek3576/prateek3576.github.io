# Bull's eye is a gaming app where the user has to adjust the slider to match the random target value

I developed Bull's eye app from [this tutorial](https://www.raywenderlich.com) by Ray Wenderlich and added some modifications.

## This is the front page of the app. It is a game called Bull's eye where your goal is to place the slider as close as possible to the target as possible

## Your score is calculated according to how close your guess was to the target
