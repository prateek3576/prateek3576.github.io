# This is my first iOS 12 app

This is an app I made from [this tutorial](https://www.raywenderlich.com) with some modifications of my own.

## This is the front page of the app. It is a game called Bull's eye where your goal is to place the slider as close as possible to the target as possible

{:.text-center .text-danger}

## Your score is calculated according to how close your guess was to the target

![image]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/project-img/bulls4.png){:height="30%" width="50%"}![image]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/project-img/bulls5.png){:height="30%" width="50%"}

{:.text-center .text-success}

## I implemented a new view to add my website view to the game
