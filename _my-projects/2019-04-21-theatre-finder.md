# Me & my group made this project for CS1520 at PITT

{:.lead}
I worked mostly on the front-end

{:.text-center .text-info}

## This is the front page of the website. It prompts the user for the permission to use their current location and then locates the movie theatres around them

![image]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/project-img/theatre2.png){:height="30%" width="67%"}![image]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/project-img/theatre3.png){:height="30%" width="32%"}

{:.text-center .text-danger}

## Once the user selects a theatre, the information is updated on the right panel. (Shown above)

![image]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/project-img/theatre4.png){:height="30%" width="100%"}

{:.text-center .text-success}

## We also implemented a user login
