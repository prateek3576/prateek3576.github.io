        <br>
        <p>I'm an undergraduate student in the Department of Computer Engineering at the University of
            Pittsburgh, and part of the Institute's class of 2020. My academic and professional interests are spread
            over numerous faces, I've worked with topics ranging from data, software as well as web development among
            other projects.<br><br>
            Let’s go beyond the technical realm, I spend hours listening to different kinds of music and I occasionally
            play with “masalas” (Spices) in the kitchen to develop new enchanting dishes.<br><br>
            I don’t claim to be the best at anything, as I strongly believe that each and every one of us is gifted with
            a magical capacity to grow and evolve. I am one person who wishes to wake up each morning and climb the
            steep learning curve.
            There is no better teacher than experience that can make you fly and turn aspirations to reality</p>
